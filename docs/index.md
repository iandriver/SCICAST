==================

scicast (Single Cell Iterative Clustering and Significance Testing) what does it do?
------------
When approaching large RNA sequencing datasets (single cell or bulk with replicates) the first question is often what are the subsets/groups/populations and what are the defines those groups? This software is designed to do that rapidly and provide the results in multiple visual and data formats that can be used for further analysis.

How do I use it?
------------
After following the installation instructions, it is usable through a gui and through the command line. Both the gui and the command line do the same thing and the command is logged in "scicast_command_log.txt" so that it can be re-run by scicast "copy from log".
